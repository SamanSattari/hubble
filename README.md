##Confluence 


If you don't have Confluence already installed somewhere or want to setup a local development environment then we recommend using docker:
[Confluence container](https://hub.docker.com/r/cptactionhank/atlassian-confluence/)
docker run --detach --name conf --publish 8090:8090 cptactionhank/atlassian-confluence:5.8.5 


https://hub.docker.com/r/cptactionhank/atlassian-confluence/
To enable the remote API:
